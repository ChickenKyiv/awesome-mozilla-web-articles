# The WebSocket API (WebSockets)

The **WebSocket API** is an advanced technology that  makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session  between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send  messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having  to poll the server for a reply.

> **Note:** While a WebSocket connection is functionally somewhat similar to standard Unix-style sockets, they are not related.

## Interfaces

- [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)

  The primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the connection.

- `CloseEvent`

  The event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.

- [`MessageEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent)

  The event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.
